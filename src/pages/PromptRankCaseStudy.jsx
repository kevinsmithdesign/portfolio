            I evaluated both direct and indirect competitors to identify feature
            gaps in prompt optimization. While most platforms offer basic prompt
            sharing, they lack structured ranking, refinement, and gamification.
            PromptRank bridges these gaps, providing a comprehensive,
            user-driven system for ranking, refining, and testing prompts—making
            it the most feature-complete platform in the space.

            To design an effective solution, I identified key user groups
            struggling with AI prompting—each with unique motivations and
            challenges. From AI enthusiasts seeking efficiency to professionals
            refining AI-generated content, users face common frustrations:
            trial-and-error workflows, lack of feedback, and difficulty
            optimizing prompts.
